# Project Proposal
# Project Title: FoodSafe
# What is FoodSafe?
FoodSafe is a software that will allow its user to select which allergies they may have, such as: peanuts, tree nuts, gluten, dairy, vegetarian, vegan, kosher, etc. The user will also be able to enter which type of food they are interested in, or be able to upload a whole grocery list. The software will then suggest food products that are allergy free and safe for the user to eat. This software will help those with allergies that struggle to find foods they can eat and spend hours in grocery stores looking at the ingredients on the back of products. I want to create this software because I myself am allergic to all nuts and have spent a lot of time searching for products that I can eat.
# Who FoodSafe is for?
FoodSafe is for anyone that has allergies and struggle finding foods that they can eat while grocery shopping. 
# How will FoodSafe work?
User will select which allergy they contain and then enter in which food product they are interested in purchasing. The software can either recommend products based on other users recommendatinons, potentially using a food database that contains nutrients, or searching online and pulling products from websites and grocery store websites.   
# Scope
I believe that this project has both simplicity and comlpexity that is niether too easy nor too difficult for a group. I believe the most difficult task is going to be figuring out how to filter food allergy and food product. However, I think that this task will be manageable by a group of 4-6 people.
